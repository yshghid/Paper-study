# Paper-study

Paper Study is written to implement computational biology algorithm papers, allowing them to be run without separate data downloads. 
The written code generates small data that meets the minimum biological requirements, aiming for an intuitive understanding of the pipeline. 
Efforts have been made to minimize the data that needs to be downloaded, but if necessary, it can be downloaded from each directory.
