# Paper-study

Paper Study has coded papers on bioinformatics and graph theory algorithms. 

## README

The code is designed to provide an intuitive understanding of the pipeline outlined in the paper, and therefore, it has been written to proceed without the need for separate data downloads. It is hoped that this will help understand the changes in data resulting from the application of the algorithm.


## Papers

1) Cliques for the identification of gene signatures for colorectal cancer across population [1][1]

2) Network propagation for GWAS analysis: a practical guide to leveraging molecular networks for disease gene discovery [2][2]

3) PropaNet: Time-Varying Condition-Specific Transcriptional Network Construction by Network Propagation [3][3]
